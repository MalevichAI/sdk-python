title: Authorization
---

The SDK allows you to save authorization data for Core, as well as authorization data for Docker repositories. Data is stored in the `~/.malevich` directory. Saving credentials allows automatic use of sensitive data without the need to specify them explicitly in code.

## Core Authorization

### Adding Core Credentials

To add Core credentials, use the command:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds add core <username> <password>
```

By default, if credentials already exist, they will not be replaced. To explicitly specify overwrite, use the `--overwrite` flag:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds add core myuser mypassword --overwrite
```

You can also specify a custom path for storing configuration:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds add core myuser mypassword --path /custom/path/.malevich
```

### Viewing Core Credentials

To view stored Core credentials:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds list core
```

### Removing Core Credentials

To remove Core credentials:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds remove core <username>
```

## Docker Repository Authorization

### Adding Repository Credentials

To add Docker repository credentials:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds add image <registry> <username> <token>
```

Examples:

```bash
# GitHub Container Registry
malevich-sdk creds add image ghcr.io/malevichai USERNAME ghp_token123

# Docker Hub
malevich-sdk creds add image docker.io dockeruser dckr_pat_xyz123
```

By default, existing credentials for the specified repository will be replaced. For explicit specification, use `--overwrite`:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds add image ghcr.io/malevichai myuser mytoken --overwrite
```

### Viewing Repository Credentials

To view all stored repository credentials:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds list image
```

### Removing Repository Credentials

To remove credentials for a specific repository:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds remove image <registry>
```

Example:

```bash
malevich-sdk creds remove image ghcr.io/malevichai
```

## Additional Operations

### Clearing All Credentials

To remove all stored credentials (Core and repositories):

```bash
malevich-sdk creds clear
```
